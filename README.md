JBoss BPM Suite Travel Agency with DV Integration Demo
======================================================
This is an online employee travel booking process project. It contains multiple web services for looking up data for the process
and rules to calculate pricing. Furthermore, there are several tasks that can be activated to evaluate pricing and to review the
final booking data before completing the booking. There are diverse data sources integrated to supply the flight and hotel web
services with disparate data through the JBoss Data Virtualization product.
